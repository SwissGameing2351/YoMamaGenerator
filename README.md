# How to use
Just run the python file in a terminal with both "YoMamaSo.txt" and "She.txt" or it cannot generate hilaroius yo mama jokes.
# How to use (GUI version)
Same as the CLI version, run the python file in a terminal (creating a menu shortcut is also possible) with both "YoMamaSo.txt" and "She.txt". You'll also have to install **zenipy** (https://github.com/poulp/zenipy) or it cannot generate hilarious yo mama jokes either.
# How to add more very funny jokes
The **YoMamaSo.txt** file is for adjectives such as "fat", "ugly", etc. You will have to write them in one line.

*Example:* ![Screenshot from 2021-08-11 20-12-37](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74509173/129081424-a6778fcd-804e-4e8c-847d-de673af4b7e2.png)

The **She.txt** file is for the final joke part such as "She broke her chair", etc. Each joke, you must make a new line.
